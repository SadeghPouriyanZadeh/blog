    <h2>HMIB (Hierarchical Modular Intelligent Being)</h2>
    <p>
      today i dreamed about an idea that what if there would be an intelligent
      being that is consisted of multiple intelligent beings that are related to
      each other in a hierarchical manner. they can interact with each other.
      the higher-level intelligent being can override the lower-level one
      whenever it wants. the lower-level is completely independent unless the
      higher-level one overrides it.
